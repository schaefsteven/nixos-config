# Firefox
- Can't set `full-screen-api.ignore-widgets = true` from nix because Firefox doesn't allow it for "stability reasons."
- Can set ui.prefersReducedMotion, but using 1 makes it true instead of 1 which does not work
- Might be able to include userChrome.css, but not trying for now.
- SearchEngines.Default is only supported in ESR for some reason? 

- Vimium C config - might be able to add to repo and only have to export/import? file is in ~/files/portable-tools/
